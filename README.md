# Palestinian Gay Pride Flag üáµüá∏üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà
I first saw this design at a Brooklyn Rally and [posted on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/QueerVexillology/comments/17iuy1h/queers_for_palestine_from_102823_brooklyn_rally/), and tried for a while to find the original creator of the flag, but had no luck. So I decided to design one myself. I based this design on the [flag of Palestine](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_Palestine.svg) and used the colors of the [rainbow pride flag](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gay_Pride_Flag.svg), but kept the red and green from the flag of Palestine.

## Construction
I started by drawing a sketch of the design I wanted. The flag of palesting is a horizontal tricolor with a proportion of 2:1. This flag has a proportion of 22:15 because I added two more stripes of the same height and expanded the chevron keeping its aspect ratio. See this for the construction:

## Alternative version
I created an alternative version with propotions of 2:1 to keep the chevron occupying one third of width the flag. I think this is closer to the original design. What annoys me though is that the rainbow stripes are now very close to being rhombi but not quite: One side of each rainbow color parallelogram is (30 total width - 4 red chevron portion)/5 remaining rainbow colors = 5.2, while the other side is 5.
